# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a newly initialized repository for an expense splitter application. The codebase structure and build tooling have not yet been established.

## Next Steps

When developing this application, key decisions will need to be made:
- Frontend framework/library (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- Backend technology (Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, etc.)
- Database choice (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.)
- Build tooling (Vite, Webpack, etc.)
- Testing framework
- Deployment strategy

Once the project structure is established, this file should be updated with:
- Build, test, and development commands
- Architecture overview
- Database schema and data flow
- API endpoints and authentication approach
